                    Did Margot Robbie dissapoint at the 2024 Oscars? The starlet shocked 
                    fans by ditching her signature pink Barbie style for a classic sequined
                    black gown. While we're used to seeing Margot paint the town pink, 
                    her bold departure from the norm proves that even Hollywood's brightest 
                    stars can defy expectations. Join us as we dissect her stunning black 
                    ensemble and unravel the mystery behind this style shift.
