                    Kim Kardashian has arrived at the 2024 Vanity Fair 
                    Oscar Party in a silky sculptural white custom gown
                    by Balenciaga, a design that hails from the house's 
                    pre-fall 2024 show where it first showed in black. 
                    Now, with the brand's darling debuting the dress 
                    in this bright, minimalist colour palette, a new 
                    iteration of this striking outfit has been revealed 
                    for the first time.
