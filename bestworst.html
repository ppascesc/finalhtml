                Alexandra Daddario had some fun with her Alexis Mabille ensemble,
                which featured an enormous circular bow detail that she swooshed 
                around in. She teamed it with Rahaminov Diamonds.<br>As expected, 
                the Oppenheimer star Robert Downey Jr. wore another eye-catching number 
                at last night's Oscars, where he picked up a statuette for Best 
                Supporting Actor and gave a shout out to his stylist, Erica. Decked 
                in Saint Laurent, the 48-year-old donned a monochrome suit with a 
                bolo tie. And despite the lack of formal neckwear, it was his 
                high-waisted, wide-leg trousers that has grabbed our attention.

                Andrea Riseborough's tartan dress is channeling a quilt. Riseborough, 
                who was controversially nominated for her performance in 'To Leslie" 
                last year, returned to the Oscars red carpet this year in a Loewe dress, 
                which unfortunately only served to distorn her figure into an 
                unflattering and awkward shape.<br>The Moana star walked the red 
                carpet in a metallic silver Dolce & Gabbana suit, featuring burgundy-lined 
                silk shirt which nearly cut down to his navel. Unfortunately the 
                outfit more closely resembles a pijama ensemble than anything one would 
                wear to the Oscars.
