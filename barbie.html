                    The cast of “Barbie” will go down in red-carpet history for their
                    dedication to method dressing, as stars Margot Robbie and Ryan 
                    Gosling diligently showed up to press events, premieres and 
                    award shows in outfits that could have been borrowed straight 
                    from Barbie and Ken's dollhouse closets. <br>But at the Academy 
                    Awards on Sunday, where the summer blockbuster was nominated for 
                    nine awards, including “Best Picture,” Robbie appeared to pass 
                    the pink torch to co-star America Ferrera, wearing a striking black 
                    (but decidedly non-Barbie-like) gown while Ferrera arrived in shimmering 
                    hot pink. Our theory is that Margot wanted to highlight th fact that it 
                    was her co-star's night and not her own, seeing as Ferrera was nominated 
                    for Best Supporting Actress, while Robbie was snubbed.

                    audiences buzzing as he took to the stage singing "I'm Just Ken" 
                    alongside a chorus of other Kens, delivering a number reminiscent of

                    Friend." Witness Gosling's dazzling homage to classic Hollywood
